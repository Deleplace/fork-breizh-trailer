5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Marty ! Doc !

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,210
What happened to the DeLorean ?

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,150
Remember, at the end of BTTF 3 it has been crushed by a train

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,100
What happened to the DeLorean ?

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,239
It didn't passed technical inspection anymore

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,430


11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,790
and this one can drive up to 120 km

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,530


13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,670
it's way enough when one travel ... in time !

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,170
But, why this outfit ?

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh damn, you're right : Marty, 

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,290
We have to fix the future !

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,320
Future ? What's up with future ?

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm just back from year 2042

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,210
at a time earth has been devastated

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,259
By nuclear weapons
What ?

21
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,369
Yes, a technical bug 

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,890
in computers chips

23
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,869
allowed North Corea to hack

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,830
Chineese nuclear system

25
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,320
(which was still running a pirated Windows XP)

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,539
and in 2022, BOOM!

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
At this time, Trump (just being re-elected) decided to hit back

28
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,530
and Poutine ...

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,070
anyway, there's nothing left

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,869
What can we do ?

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,429
Need to fix this problem from source

32
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,220
prevent this bug being introduced in processors

33
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:33,950
How ?

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,259
This bug has been introduced in 1988


35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,820
In 1988 !?

36
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,829
Yes, due to backward compatibility


37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,329
this implementation detail

38
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,820
is still present in 2022's CPUs.

39
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,049
The hardware architect, who introduced the bug by mistake,

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,119
was working on this topic

41
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,009
in 1988 

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,740
and this when we need to act
You're the Doc, Doc

43
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,210
Where can we find this "architect" ?

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,799
He made a lecture at BreizhCamp

45
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,780
not far away

46
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,100
hum, not far in space, but

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,750
in time it was 30 years ago

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,680
anyway, distances 

49
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,490
in space-time continuum

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,799
are very abstract concepts

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,890
As you say so, Doc. 

52
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,950
Don't spend more time. 

53
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,010
Put on these 80's closes, I remove this

54
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,269
hurry up ! 

55
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,750
We don't need to hurry actually

56
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,870
Bu not doing so, this movie would be so boring !

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,090
Spate-time convector will

58
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,890
get us back in 1988. I'm configuring it

59
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,069
to arrive on first day of BreizhCamp conference

60
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,819
on March 28th 1988

61
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,500
Let's put on our seatbelt !

62
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,120
No need for security Marty!

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:48,790
Where we go we don't need root ! 
(road "route" in french == "root")

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:50,510
Hello

65
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,680
can I take your name for badges ?

66
00:02:50,510 --> 00:03:01,970
Mar...
Mark Zuckerberg ! and I'm Linus Torvalds

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:03,280
ok, please 50 francs for entrance

68
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:10,310
Oups, seems I made a mistake with your name
Never mind

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,420
How exciting, isn't it ?

70
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,349
Let's check this place,

71
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,590
we'll be here in two minutes

72
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:18,530
Waou, that's high dÃ©finition !

73
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,859
Yes indeed, it's Super VGA,

74
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,750
up to 1024x768 with 16 colours 

75
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,959
It's perfect match for a graphic workstation

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,290
Is it free ?
hum, not really...

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,000
Hello sir ! 

78
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,350
Are you a developer ?
What ?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,209
Do you know our development environment

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,010
DosDEV ?

81
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,709
It's a highly productive environnement

82
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,610
up to 10 time faster 

83
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,740
than what you've been used to

84
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,140
I give you the brochure

85
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,160
don't hesitate to give it a try

86
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:55,290
OMG, one did crazy things in 80's

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:57,450
F***, this game is a piece of shit !

88
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,970
Seem they where drunk or drugged coding it 

89
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:08,459
I'll become crazy with it

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:09,740
or maybe an angry video game nerd?

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,790
McFly !!!
did you fix the Street Fighter arcade in the cafetaria ?

92
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,110
Not yet Biff, that's a complex job you know ...

93
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,760
as you overthrow Coke on it ...

94
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,140
And how do you expect me

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,060
to train for the challenge

96
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,000
if you don't fix the arcade ?
I'll do it today, I promise.

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,800
... Dad is a Nerd !
Hey Marty, here you are

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,540
Sorry for that, would prefer you don't see him

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,060
but you know, in 2018

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,770
beeing a geek will be cool ... surprisingly

101
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,280
If you say so, Doc
Let's go

102
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,260
... and with the new memory model

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,220
and unified cache we will get

104
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:43,610
80x386 architecture way beyong

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:54,000
it's initial capacity

106
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:55,890
We get execution speed moslty doubled !

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,410
Come and ask him any questions

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,880
while I'm fixing his documents

109
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,680
Hello, interesting lecture. I wonder ...

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,950
how far will you get this new generation

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,110
what's its execution frequency ?

112
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,190
25 MHz ! and we even have in labs

113
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,490
a 33 MHz prototype
interesting ... 

114
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,360
And with 8 ko integrated cache 

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,250
and a 32 bits communication bus

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,110
we will have access to huge resources

117
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,520
Imagine:

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,140
We could even go beyong the 640k limit :)

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,880
but .. what about heat ?

120
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,220
You're right, with incredibly fine engraving

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,560
at only 1 micron, this becomes an issue

122
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,860
We are looking for workarounds

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,840
maybe will need a heat dissipator
oh right, thanks

124
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,090
I'm done Marty, we can leave

125
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,590
McFly, McFly what's the hell are you doing. Learn programming ?

126
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,000
Not fixing the Arcade ?

127
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,539
But you know ...

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,550
Hope we haven't altered the space-time continuum

129
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,289
Hello, hello, anybody home?
Think, McFly. Think!

130
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,430
Do you realize what would happen 

131
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,870
if I start the challenge

132
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,580
without being trained enough ? Want me to be a looser ?

133
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,650
Want me to be look like an idiot during challenge ? 

134
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,909
Is it what you're looking for ?
Of course not, Biff 

135
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,430
now I wouldn't want that to happen.

136
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:07,490
Hey sir, you left this on the floor

137
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,279
Oh thanks.
Great game, you'll get lot's of fun with it

138
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,810
Hey McFly, I'll train on this one

139
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,240
waiting for you to fix the arcade

140
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,699


141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,639
I'll work on it first thing tomorrow, alright?

142
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,810
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. 

143
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,810
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

144
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,380
Tell me Doc, this Intel Architect

145
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:36,710
How did you know it was speaking at BreizhCamp ?
Matry,

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:38,030
Best speakers all come to BreizhCamp !
